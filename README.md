# Solana Unreal SDK


![solanaue5-bifrost](https://github.com/Bifrost-Technologies/Solana-UnrealEngine5-SDK/assets/24855008/f292c889-3f0e-44d6-96d4-f4ac0e2d5c2c)


A complete game template and toolkit for building blockchain games on Solana with Unreal Engine 5.

The toolkit comes with a starting template for Solana games(top down, 3rd person or first person), a multiplayer game server SDK, and REST API Http server to handle global server calls for players.

Using UnrealCLR, we can use [SOL.NET](https://github.com/bmresearch/Solnet) and the power of .NET runtime inside the game giving developers the ability to communicate with the Solana blockchain without having to build an entire c++ library from scratch.

 For specific application types like VR/AR/XR where an in-game wallet would be needed then we use UnrealCLR to call the Solana UE5 SDK directly in the game.
 Using [LinkStream](https://github.com/Bifrost-Technologies/Link-Stream) the game is capable of requesting signing via [Tranquility Wallet](https://github.com/Bifrost-Technologies/Tranquility) and popular mobile wallets through encrypted TCP & Websocket loopback mechanics.
